### CRUD courses web
Its a simple CRUD (create, read, update, delete) system page for managing different courses

#### Features:
- Add new courses with name, price, capacity, description, category
- Display all courses in a table
- Update, edit existing courses
- Delete single courses or delete all courses
- Search courses by name, description, category

#### Notes:
- The price and capacity should be numbers only
- All course data is stored in `localStorage` in your browser, so clearing browser storage will delete all courses
